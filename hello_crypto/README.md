Babby's first cipher.

The ouput will look something like: 

Input String to Encrypt: we the people in order to form a more perfect union

The first row prints out the input string.

The First column of RESULTS data is the input string removed of spaces, and broken into 4 character tokens.

The 2nd column is the result of ciphering each 4 character token with a basic ceasar cipher.

The 3rd column is the modulo remainder of the ciphered token with a 20 digit prime number.
